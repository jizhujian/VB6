About the Drop-Down Form Control
This control allows to create drop-down tool windows which the user
can drag off and float like the colour picker provided with Microsoft
Office.

In addition, it also provides a titlebar modifier which ensures that 
your application's main form gets and keeps the focus regardless of
whether a tool window takes the input focus, making your app look and
behave in a more professional manner.

Any bugs or problems should be reported to the author 
(steve@vbaccelerator.com) for incorporation into future releases.

Installation Requirements
The control requires Visual Basic 5 with at least Service Pack 2 applied
and SSubTmr.DLL (available from http://vbaccelerator.com/)
